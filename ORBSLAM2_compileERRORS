ERROR: Pangolin could not be found because dependency Eigen3 could not be found
FIX: https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2/issues/1015
shaoxh commented on Sep 3, 2021
I solve it. I found Pangolin has a upgrade to version 0.6 and the author make it to comply with c++ 17 or something. but orbslam2 reconment to c++ 11.
a higher version Pangolin is not suitble even it is installed.
1st, check the /usr/local/include. is there a signals derectory? if yes, delete it.
2ed, remove Pangolin files and clone 0.5 version codes.
3rd, rebuild it and install it.
to end, build orbslam2 (I was using build.sh).
hope it can help.
