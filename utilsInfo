5. GBD debugger: 
    When I try to set a breakpoint at a line of a source file, it says: module containing this breakpoint has not yet loaded or the breakpoint address could not be obtained.
    There are tips for resolving the issue, e.g., add -g when you compile and set CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG "-g -O0 -Wall".
    All those did not work for me. And finally, I found that it is the problem caused by the additional config command set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG "-fPIC") in the corresponding CMakeList.txt.
    After commenting out this line, and recompile the source code, there is no any complain when trying to set breakpoints.

    There are some useful links for explaining the configuration variable and flags of a CMakeList.tex:
