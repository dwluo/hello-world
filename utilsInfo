5. GBD debugger: 
    When I try to set a breakpoint at a line of a source file, it says: module containing this breakpoint has not yet loaded or the breakpoint address could not be obtained.
    There are tips for resolving the issue, e.g., add -g when you compile and set CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG "-g -O0 -Wall".
    All those did not work for me. And finally, I found that it is the problem caused by the additional config command set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG "-fPIC") in the corresponding CMakeList.txt.
    After commenting out this line, and recompile the source code, there is no any complain when trying to set breakpoints.
